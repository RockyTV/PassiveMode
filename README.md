PassiveMode
===========

PassiveMode is a plugin for the Just Cause 2 Multiplayer mod. 

The plugin works like the GTA V online passive mode - you are still able to run over your enemies.
When you are in passive mode, you can't shoot other players and they can't shoot you. And, it is persistent. If you join a server, become passive and then rejoin the server, you will still be on passive mode.

Commands:

/passive - Typing it for the first time will make you a passive player. Typing it again will disable it.
