{"name":"Passive Mode","tagline":"A Just Cause 2 Multiplayer plugin","body":"### Passive Mode\r\nPassive Mode is a plugin for the Just Cause 2 Multiplayer modification. \r\n\r\nIt allows players to type in a chat command and become passive - they wont receive damage from other players, and the other players wont receive their damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\nWhen you first type ```/passive``` or ```/afk```, you will become a passive player.
